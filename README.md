    - map location of transmitting OMs
    - graphic statistics etc...

    cd ndmonitor

    to install needed packages : 
    
        npm install
    
    then make a config.ts file
        
        cd src
        cp config_sample.txt config.ts

    /**
    * gencode utility (crc16 based)
    */
    if you decide to make your dashbaord private with a password, you'll need to: 

        - set config.__web_auth__ to true
        - set config.__web_secret_key__ to "a new secret key"
        - use gencode to compute a password from your login string

    After the secret key has been set just do:

        node ./dist/gencode.ts mylogin <enter>

    if everyhting is ok, you'll get a string of 4 or 5 digits that will be your password (nothing is stored anywhere)
    

**NDMonitor is based on HBMon V1 a "web dashboard" for HBlink by N0MJS.**
**and a newer version HBMon V2 (2021) by SP2ONG**
